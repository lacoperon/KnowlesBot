#KnowlesBot

Welcome to the KnowlesBot README! KnowlesBot is the Messenger Bot that I developed
for my roommate and I to more effectively manage living together slash the day to day things we want to do. The messenger server back end is deployed using Heroku,
but there are also other components that will work through a Raspberry Pi
(IE Spotify + Netflix + Youtube integration)

Current Ideas:

  * Timers and Reminders
  * Video streaming via VLC through command line on Raspberry Pi via Chromecast
  * Netflix streaming through Tasker and Google Chrome via Chromecast
  * Spotify streaming through Mopidy and Bluetooth
  * Weird, idiosyncratic things (like Wesley Crusher Memes, etc.)
  * Shopping Lists
  * Event/Exam Reminders (for extra courtesy towards someone studying for something)
  * Some sort of ability for friends to figure out what we're up to in an
    externally facing way (IE board game nights, parties, concerts, etc.)
  * Ability to query when certain establishments are open (IE ION, Weshop)
